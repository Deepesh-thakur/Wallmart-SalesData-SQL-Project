# Wallmart-SalesData-SQL-Project
Wrote advanced SQL queries for data analysis, including GROUP BY, SUM(), AVG(), and DISTINCT to generate sales insights. 

Applied SQL built-in mathematical functions like ABS(), POWER(), RAND(), CEILING(), FLOOR(), and EXP() for data calculations. 

Performed extensive date and time operations using functions like GETDATE(), DATEADD(), DATEDIFF(), FORMAT(), EOMONTH(), and DATENAME(). 

Utilized data type conversion functions: CAST(), CONVERT(), and string functions like SUBSTRING(), CONCAT(). 

Practiced creating structured sales reports â€” city-wise, product-line-wise, and date-wise using real-world retail datasets.
